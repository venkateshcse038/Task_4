I will give you a xml file in that you have to count how many Image number tag where present. Example under page number 1  tag if there is a image number tag was present on time means total count is 1. Then check the page number 2 tag and if there are 5 image number tag under the page number 2 tag means, the total number of tag = 6. 
Are you understood.
